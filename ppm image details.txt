A PPM file consists of two parts, a header and the image data
header has 3 parts:
line 1: The first "line" is a magic PPM identifier, it can be "P3" or "P6"
line 2: width and height seperated by space
line 3: maximum value of the color components for the pixels (which will be 255)

#Example
P6 
1024 788 
255

image format:
 If it is "P3" then the image is given as ascii text, 
 the numerical value of each pixel ranges from 0 to the maximum value given in the header. 
 The lines should not be longer than 70 characters.

 If the PPM magic identifier is "P6" then the image data is stored in byte format, 
 one byte per colour component (r,g,b).
